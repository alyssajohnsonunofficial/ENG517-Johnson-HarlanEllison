## All About Harlan Ellison

### Top 5 People Harlan Ellison Had Beef With
1. Dr. Shedd - his OSU professor who said his writing sucked. He slapped the prof, got expelled, and then sent the prof a copy of everything he ever published for the rest of his life.
2. Charles Platt - an author and journalist he assaulted at the Nebula Awards banquet. They signed a non-aggression pact and agreed to never discuss it or have contact with each other again.
3. James Cameron - director of 'The Terminator' and guy who Ellison sued for copyright. Said Ellison's lawsuit was a nuisance suit. 
4. Gene Roddenberry - creator and producer of 'Star Trek.' Ellison got mad that Roddenberry and others rewrote his original script for an episode, but kept his name on the script instead of using one of the aliases he employed when he was displeased with a project. 
5. His Fans - Ellison said he hated his fans, especially the ones who interrupted him to ask for photos and autographs in really inconvenient moments. There's a lot of content where he's being kind to fans though, so I think he was being dramatic.

### My Favorite Facts About Harlan Ellison
* Violently opposed the Vietnam War. As the Guest of Honor at AggieCon, which was Texas A&M University's first sci-fi con, he made so many anti-military comments that it started a foodfight in the ballroom. 
* Claimed he worked as a "hired gun for a wealthy neurotic." Also worked as a nitroglycerin truck driver in NC, which sounds way more believable. 
* Went through 4 short, failed marriages before meeting the love of his life, Susan Toth. They were married from 1986 to his death. I'm jealous. 
* Used the moniker 'Cordwainer Bird' in situations where he felt his creative contributions had been destroyed by others involved in the project. 
* Had bipolar disorder, but didn't find out until a few years before he died. 
* Of the three volumes of his 'Dangerous Visions' collection, there was a 52-53 year difference between the releases of the second and third books, and the third was published 5 years or so after he died. There's a lot of lore there.
